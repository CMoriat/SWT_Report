\section{Conclusion}
The process of developing the Air Traffic Monitoring system and compile this journal was made in two weeks. During these weeks multiple strategies from the courses I4SWT and I4SWD were used to satisfy the requirements given. \\ 
At all times during the design, implementation and testing, it was ensured that every module should follow the SOLID principles used in agile development. It was given that the requirements could be changed at a time which potentially could cause a major need for re-implementing the system. \\
Even though it might have taken longer to develop the ATM knowing the possibility of a requirement change, it worked as a great way to motivate reflections upon the design of the system. Furthermore being able to try the different unit testing practices on a larger scale and compare these has been interesting.
