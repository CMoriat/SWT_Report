\section{Teamwork}
In this section the teamwork is described. The requirements were 3-4 people in a group and no more than two persons should share a computer while programming. Another requirement was the use of \emph{Continuous Integration}, which helps the developers commit to a shared build server multiple times during the development process.

\subsection{Strategies}
We have earlier tried working with some of the strategies from Extreme Programming which were found suitable for this project. One of these was \emph{Pair programming}. Code is then written by pairs which shares the workstation. One will be in control of the keyboard and write the code while the other will watch the code and work towards the best implementation. The pair switches place every now and then. This ensures that both programmers are engaged in the software.

\subsection{Continuous integration}
As the group was divided into two pairs of developers each working on classes of their own, the continuous integration helped the groups gaining a shared understanding on the software development process.
