\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this journal is to reflect upon the design, implementation and test of the Air Traffic Monitor system (ATM).\\
The exercise required not only a working system, but a special effort had to be made to obtain a generic design with an appropiate amount of tests which should be simple to maintain if changes in the exercise requirements were to be made. \\

%3.3 Requirements for your journal\\
%You are required to hand in a short report (6-10 pages) along with an implementation of your system. The purpose of the report is for you to demonstrate reflection on how you designed, implemented, and tested your system. A non-exhaustive list of questions that can help you reflect on the exercise is:\\
%What software architecture did you arrive at for the system, and how did you arrive at it?\\
%How did you divide the software classes between group members for implementation and test? Why did you divide it as you did?\\
%What strategy did you select for your integration test? Why?\\
%How did the use of a CI server help you â€“ did it help you at all? How/why not?\\
%In general, describe anything good or bad you have learned from this exercise in the report.\\

%Apart from this, the report must contain:\\
%Class diagrams and sequence diagrams to explain the structure and behavior of your system\\
%A dependency tree for your software to support your integration tests.\\
